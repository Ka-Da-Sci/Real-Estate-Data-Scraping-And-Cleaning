This is a real estate data scraping and cleaning project - strictly for educational purpose only.
The generated results as at the moment of this release are included in csv and json formats.

Note that though Multiprocessing was utilised to achieve concurrency here, asyncio and Futures(concurrent.futures) are better for achieving concurrency with I/O-bound tasks such as web scraping.
